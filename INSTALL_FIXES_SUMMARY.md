# Install/Uninstall Functionality Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Prerequisites Check ✅
- **Problem**: Test script was skipping tests when `gnome-extensions` wasn't available
- **Fix**: Added `gnome-extensions` to required prerequisites in `test_install.sh`
- **Location**: `test_install.sh` lines 77-81

### 2. CLI Shell Refresh Methods ✅
- **Problem**: Scripts only suggested manual Alt+F2 restart
- **Fix**: Implemented automatic CLI refresh methods:
  - `busctl --user call org.gnome.Shell /org/gnome/Shell org.gnome.Shell Eval s 'Meta.restart("")'`
  - `gnome-shell --replace &`
- **Location**: New `refresh_gnome_shell()` function in `install.sh` lines 117-156

### 3. Install Timing Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Extension not appearing in `gnome-extensions list` immediately after install
- **Fix**: 
  - Added automatic GNOME Shell refresh after failed registration
  - Increased wait times and retry attempts
  - Better error handling with automatic recovery
- **Location**: 
  - `install.sh` lines 228-258 (installation registration logic)
  - `install.sh` lines 442-472 (uninstall cleanup logic)

### 4. Test Robustness ✅
- **Problem**: Tests failing due to timing issues
- **Fix**:
  - Added retry logic with multiple attempts to check extension list
  - Increased wait times between checks (3 seconds)
  - Better error reporting
- **Location**: `test_install.sh` lines 227-260

## Key Improvements

### Install Process (`install.sh`)
1. **Better Registration Waiting**: Now waits longer and tries automatic refresh if registration fails
2. **Automatic Shell Refresh**: Uses CLI methods instead of just suggesting manual restart
3. **Improved Error Recovery**: Automatically attempts to fix registration issues

### Uninstall Process (`install.sh`)
1. **Complete Cleanup**: Better removal from extension list
2. **Automatic Refresh**: Tries CLI methods to refresh shell after uninstall
3. **Verification**: Checks that extension is actually removed from list

### Test Script (`test_install.sh`)
1. **Strict Prerequisites**: No longer skips tests when tools are missing
2. **Retry Logic**: Multiple attempts to check extension listing with proper delays
3. **Better Timing**: Longer waits between operations to handle GNOME Shell delays

## Test Sequence Validation

The enhanced test now properly validates:
1. ✅ Uninstall → Extension NOT in `gnome-extensions list`
2. ✅ Install → Extension IS in `gnome-extensions list`
3. ✅ Version verification via D-Bus
4. ✅ Proper cleanup after each operation

## Next Steps

To test these fixes:
1. Run `./test_install.sh` in a GNOME environment
2. The test should now pass all phases including extension listing verification
3. Manual verification: `gnome-extensions list` should show/hide the extension appropriately
